# PlotEquation

This is an upload of the C# plugin I made during high school - my first real CS project. It successfully creates multiple mathematical objects (such as equation curves, equation surfaces, stereographic projections, lindemayer systems, etc.) and uses a class structure with inheritance, but it does not implement an efficient use of data structures.
